# Discord-TempChannels

To use this bot you need to fill .env with your environment variables.
Create .env
```
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=
DISCORD_VOICE_CATEGORY=
DISCORD_PERM_VOICE_ID=
```

You can get the Bot token by creating a Bot app in https://discord.com/developers/applications/

The ids for the Guild (Server), Category, and Permanent Voice ID can be done by right-clicking each and copying the ID

***WARNING***: This bot will automatically delete all other voice channels in the category you select. I suggest making a dedicated category specifically for this bot instead of reusing an existing category.
